# assignLT

Steps that I want to follow.
1. At very first I will create an ec2-instance with terraform.
2. Then I will configure ELK stack with the help of Ansible role and it's dynamic inventory feature.
3. I will use Ansible to copy the agent to the target machine that is to be monitored.
4. All the steps from 1 to 3 will be achieved by Jenkins job. Only thing I need to trigger to setup all is to trigger a jenkins job.
   My jenkins job is going to automate all my task and run the required commands in my behalf.


NOTE: Work is in progress...
